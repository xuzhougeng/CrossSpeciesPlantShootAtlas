# SAMap Cross-Species Integration

This module provides a pipeline for cross-species integration of single-cell transcriptomics data using SAMap.

## Overview

SAMap enables integration of single-cell data across species by identifying homologous genes and aligning datasets.

## Pipeline Components

* **SAMap_prepare.ipynb**: Data preprocessing
* **SAMap_integration.ipynb**: Cross-species integration

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Prepare input data in appropriate format
   - Process gene homology information

2. **Integration**:
   - Align datasets across species
   - Generate integrated embedding
